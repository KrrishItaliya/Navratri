          Chandraghanta is the third form of Goddess Durga. She is depicted with
          a half-moon (Chandra) shaped like a bell (Ghanta) on her forehead,
          which gives her the name Chandraghanta. This form of the Goddess is
          known for her bravery and courage and is believed to bestow strength
          and protection upon her devotees. She is often shown riding a tiger.
