          <p>
            Grey represents the first day of Navratri and is associated with
            Goddess Shailputri. Grey symbolizes the quality of stability and
            harmony. It is believed to represent the tranquil and unchanging
            nature of the mountains, as Shailputri is often depicted as the
            daughter of the Himalayas. It signifies the beginning of the
            festival and the foundation of strength and determination.
