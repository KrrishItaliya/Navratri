          Kushmanda is the fourth form of Goddess Durga. Her name is derived
          from three words: "Ku" means "little," "Ushma" means "warmth," and
          "Anda" means "cosmic egg." Kushmanda is believed to have created the
          universe with her divine smile, and she is often depicted as having
          eight or ten hands, holding various objects such as a lotus, a bow,
          and an arrow. She is the source of all energy and life.
